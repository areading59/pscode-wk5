// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(num = Even/Odd
Print Even/Odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a. Input num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
b. (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)/5=Average
Print Average
c. num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
num<num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Print result 
num>num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Print result 
d. Print <Average>, This is the average value of all the numbers. 
Print <Min> <Max> The first number is the smallest value. The latter is the largest value. )
